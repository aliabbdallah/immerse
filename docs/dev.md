4. Add reading habit analytics

### Step 3: Highlight & Note Features
1. Implement text selection and highlighting
2. Create note-taking functionality
3. Design highlight management interface
4. Add export capabilities for notes and highlights

## Phase 6: Optimization & Advanced Features

### Step 1: Performance Optimization
1. Implement lazy loading for content
2. Add caching for offline reading
3. Optimize animations and transitions
4. Reduce bundle size and improve load times

### Step 2: Developer Tooling
